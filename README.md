## Synopsis

This repository is a series of forms for a website that allow a visitor to subscribe to an organization's Mailchimp list and be automatically via the boxes they check on the form.

## Other details

Each element of the form is captured in a PHP function in order to make the code as modular as possible. Simple styling is also provided.

Any user will need to provide their own Mailchimp API key and audience list id.

## Reason for this project

Out-of-the-box forms available from Mailchimp only allow subscribers to be automatically added to groups, not tags. When an organization has already build a significant subscriber base already organized with tags, re-organizing based on groups is not feasible.
